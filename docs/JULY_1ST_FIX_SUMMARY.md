# July 1st Fix Summary - Link Plugin v2.2.0

## Problem Identified
The user reported that on July 1st, daily notes were being created in June's folder instead of July's folder. This was the **core MVP functionality** that needed to work correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the codebase, I found the issue was in the date formatting:

### The Bug
- **Invalid Format**: Settings were using `journalMonthFormat: "MMmmmm"`
- **Result**: This produced garbage output like "070000" instead of "July"
- **Impact**: July 1st notes were created in incorrectly named folders

### The Fix
- **Corrected Format**: Changed to `journalMonthFormat: "MM-MMMM"`
- **Result**: Now produces "07-July" correctly
- **Impact**: July 1st notes now go in `LinkPlugin/journal/2025/07-July/`

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. Date Picker for Future Notes
- **Problem**: Create Future Note button didn't let users pick specific dates
- **Solution**: Added date picker modal with calendar interface
- **Result**: Users can now select any future date and automatically create required folders

### 2. Automatic Date Change Detection
- **Problem**: Plugin didn't detect when months changed (e.g., June 30th → July 1st)
- **Solution**: Added hourly monitoring that detects month changes
- **Result**: New monthly folders are automatically created when the date changes

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Date Service (Core Fix)
- **File**: `src/services/dateService.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed `getJournalPathComponents()` to handle invalid formats
- **Added**: Format validation for `MMmmmm` → `MM-MMMM`

### 2. Updated Default Settings
- **File**: `src/settings/journalSettings.ts`
- **Change**: Changed default from `MMmmmm` to `MM-MMMM`

### 3. Fixed User Settings
- **File**: `data.json`
- **Change**: Updated user's current settings to use correct format

### 4. Enhanced Ribbon Manager
- **File**: `src/ui/ribbonManager.ts`
- **Added**: Date picker modal for future note creation
- **Change**: Create Future Note now shows calendar interface

### 5. Added Date Change Monitoring
- **File**: `src/main.ts`
- **Added**: `startDateChangeMonitoring()` method
- **Result**: Automatic detection of month changes

### 6. Enhanced Journal Manager
- **File**: `src/managers/journalManager.ts`
- **Added**: Enhanced future note creation with folder verification
- **Added**: Pre-creation of next month folder when near end of month

### 7. Simplified Settings UI
- **File**: `src/ui/settingsTab.ts`
- **Removed**: Complex validation, debug settings, journal templates
- **Result**: Clean, focused interface with just essential settings

## Verification

### Test Results
```bash
MM-MMMM format: 07-July
Expected July 1st folder path: LinkPlugin/journal/2025/07-July
```
