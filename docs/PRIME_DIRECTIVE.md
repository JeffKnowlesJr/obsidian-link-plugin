# Prime Directive: MVP DateFolders Plugin

This document defines the guiding principles and scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the DateFolders for DailyNotes plugin. All code and documentation must adhere to these principles until further revision.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: The plugin should provide only the essential features required for daily journal management.
- **Reliability**: All features must work consistently and predictably, with minimal configuration.
- **Minimalism**: No extra features, settings, or integrations beyond the core journal management workflow.

## MVP Scope

1. **Journal Folder Structure**
   - Automatically create and maintain a year/month/day folder structure for journal entries.
   - Allow configuration of the base folder and date formats for folders and notes.
   - Only create 'journal' folder - no reference, workspace, or other non-essential folders.

2. **Daily Note Creation**
   - Provide commands and UI to create or open today's journal note.
   - Support creation of future-dated notes.
   - Create empty notes - no template content or dynamic generation.

3. **Daily Notes Integration**
   - Optionally integrate with Obsidian's Daily Notes plugin to use the same folder and naming conventions.
   - Provide safe backup and restore of Daily Notes plugin settings.

4. **No Templates or Templater Integration**
   - The plugin does not provide, manage, or reference any template files or templating systems.
   - All template-related code, settings, and documentation must be removed.

5. **Minimal UI and Settings**
   - Only include settings and UI necessary for the above features.
   - No extra toggles, fields, or options unrelated to core journal management.
   - Removed: restrictedDirectories, documentDirectory, workspace/reference folders, and other non-MVP settings.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed MVP Simplifications
- Removed all template-related code and settings
- Removed reference and files folder structures from constants
- Simplified settings to only include essential journal management options
- Removed restrictedDirectories and documentDirectory settings
- Cleaned up constants to only include MVP functionality
- Removed workspace/reference folder options from settings UI
- Updated documentation to remove non-MVP references
- Simplified folder structure examples in documentation

### üîÑ Still Needs Attention
- Some documentation may still contain references to removed features
- Daily Notes integration settings could be simplified further
- Complex folder structure examples in some docs need final cleanup
- Ensure all settings UI only shows MVP-relevant options

## Out of Scope

- Templates, templater, or any dynamic content generation.
- Reference, workspace, or other non-journal folders.
- Advanced automation, scripting, or plugin interoperability.
- Complex folder structures beyond year/month organization.
- Settings for restricted directories or document directories.
- Template setup, management, or configuration.

## Review Guidelines

For each file, check for:

2. **Non-MVP Features**: References to reference/workspace folders, complex folder structures
3. **Deprecated Settings**: restrictedDirectories, documentDirectory, template settings
4. **Unnecessary Complexity**: Over-engineered solutions for simple MVP needs
5. **Documentation Accuracy**: Ensure docs match current MVP implementation

## Status Tracking

- ‚úÖ **Reviewed**: File has been checked and is MVP-compliant
- üîÑ **Needs Review**: File needs to be examined for deprecated code
- ‚ùå **Has Issues**: File contains non-MVP code that needs removal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**: File has some issues but mostly MVP-compliant
