- [ ] **Focus Routine**: Centering activity, priority review

## To-Do List

- [ ] **High Priority Tasks (🟥)**: Major tasks to complete today
- [ ] **Medium Priority Tasks (🟨)**: Important but non-urgent tasks
- [ ] **Low Priority Tasks (🟩)**: Routine or minor tasks

## Stream

Reflect on today's progress, challenges, and mindset.
```

### Project Template

```markdown
# Project: {{project_name}}

## Overview

- **Description**: Brief overview of the project
- **Objectives**: Key goals and deliverables

## Key Details

- **Status**: {{status}}
- **Start Date**: {{start_date}}

## Possible Features

- **Project-Based Organization**: Tag links under PARA categories and switch between views for relevant notes.
- **Task and Next Action Linking**: Integrate task management with task-specific links and a consolidated next actions list.
- **Archive Functionality**: Archive links for completed projects, reducing workspace clutter.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, collapsible UI with contextual information displayed only on interaction.
- **Guided Onboarding**: Step-by-step onboarding for new users and contextual tooltips for advanced features.
- **Visual Dashboards**: Network maps and progress trackers to motivate and visually represent link connectivity.

- **Personalized Reminders**: Timely, adjustable reminders for revisiting, updating, or adding links.

---

## Channel Stream Feature

### Key Components

- **Channel Creation & Configuration**:
  - Create custom channels (e.g., “📊 Client Work”, “📚 Research”).
  - Filter by tags, PARA categories, folders, or metadata.
- **Dynamic Filtering & Linking**:
  - Set filters to auto-populate channels.
  - Manually add specific notes as needed.
- **Real-Time Feed Updates**:
  - Channels update instantly when relevant notes are created or modified.
  - Option for notifications when new content is added.
- **Channel-Specific Views & Sorting**:
  - Display options: list, Kanban, calendar.
  - Sort by date, priority, deadline, or custom fields.
- **Channel Dashboards & Analytics**:
  - Dashboard showing key metrics (e.g., total items, recent activity).
  - Visualizations (e.g., network maps) for item connections and progress tracking.

---

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Focus**: Work within distraction-free, goal-specific channels.
- **Efficient Navigation**: Quickly access and track relevant items in each channel.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Stay current with project-specific info without manual sorting.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Setup Channels**:
   - Create channels such as “📚 Research” and “📊 Project X” with specific filters for tags, folders, or metadata.
2. **Auto-Stream Content**:
   - Configure the “Research” channel to auto-populate with all notes tagged `#research`.
3. **Focused Work**:
   - Use the “Project X” channel to view only project-specific updates, tasks, and progress logs.
4. **Cross-Reference**:
   - Leverage multi-channel linking to display notes tagged `#research` and `#projectX` in both channels.
5. **Archive**:
   - Move completed tasks and notes in “Project X” to the archive, ensuring the main feed remains clean and focused.

---

## Advanced Tips for Using the Link Plugin

### 1. **Metadata Automation**

- Use Obsidian’s Templater plugin to automate metadata population in new notes.
- Example snippet for a Project Template:
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: {{title}}
  status: active
  start_date: {{date}}
  due_date: {{date+7d}}
  tags: [#project, #active]
  ---
  ```

### 2. **Custom Views**

- Leverage Obsidian plugins like Dataview to create custom views for tasks, projects, or resources:
  ```dataview
  table status, start_date, due_date
  from #project
  where status != "completed"
  sort due_date asc
  ```

### 3. **Linking Across Notes**

- Use double-bracket links to reference related notes or tasks dynamically:
  - Example: `[[2024-11-14 Thursday]]` for quick access to the corresponding Daily Note.
- Use backlinking to see all notes referencing a specific note.

### 4. **Visualize Connections**

- Enable Obsidian’s graph view to see how notes are interconnected.
- Filter the graph by tag or folder to focus on specific projects or themes.

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### Common Issues

- **Disorganized Tags**:
  - Use a tag hierarchy (e.g., `#project/work` and `#project/personal`) for clarity.
- **Overloaded Archives**:
  - Regularly clean up and reorganize archived notes into subfolders.

### Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming**:
  - Adopt a clear, predictable naming convention for notes (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD Title.md`).
- **Review Regularly**:
  - Schedule time to review archived notes and update active project statuses.
- **Syncing and Backup**:
  - Use Obsidian Sync or a third-party service to ensure all notes are backed up securely.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Integration**:
  - Explore AI-assisted tagging and note summarization to enhance productivity.
- **Advanced Channel Filters**:
  - Support for regex and conditional filters for precise channel configurations.
- **Collaboration Tools**:
  - Add support for shared workspaces and real-time collaboration on notes.
- **Mobile Enhancements**:
  - Optimize the plugin for mobile use, including gestures for quick linking and navigation.
- **Progress Metrics**:
  - Incorporate advanced tracking, such as time spent on notes or completion rates for tasks.

By leveraging these features and best practices, the "Link" plugin can transform Obsidian into a powerful, customized note-taking and project management system.
