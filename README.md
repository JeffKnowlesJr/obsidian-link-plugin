# Obsidian Link Plugin

A simple plugin for Obsidian that helps you create and link notes quickly.

## Features

- **Quick Note Creation**: Create new notes directly from selected text or via a prompt
- **Automatic Linking**: Automatically creates wiki-style links (`[[note-name]]`) to newly created notes
- **Smart File Names**: Automatically sanitizes file names to be compatible with your file system

## Usage

1. **Create a Note from Selection**:

   - Select some text in your current note
   - Use the command "Create new linked note" (or use the hotkey if configured)
   - The selected text becomes the title of your new note
   - A link to the new note replaces your selection

2. **Create a Note from Prompt**:
   - Without any text selected, use the command "Create new linked note"
   - Enter the desired note name in the popup dialog
   - A new note will be created and linked at your cursor position

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins and disable Safe Mode
3. Click Browse and search for "Link Plugin"
4. Install the plugin and enable it
